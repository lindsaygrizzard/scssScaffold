## Are you new to SASS/ tired of looking up the structure of your SASS projects, where the imports go or what the best practices are? 

Use this as your starting point and let the helpful comments refresh your memory.


Use the 'watch' command to update all of your scss into browser usable css. 

1. cd into the sassScaffold directory
2. run `sass --watch css:scss`



More detailed notes on SCSS code to come. Currently this is only a basic scaffold for files.
