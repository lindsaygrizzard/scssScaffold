### Are you new to SASS/ tired of looking up the structure of your SASS projects, where the imports go or what the best practices are? 

####Use this as your starting point and let the helpful comments refresh your memory.


1. run `git clone https://github.com/lindsaygrizzard/scssScaffold` in command line within your desired directory 

2. Use the 'watch' command to update all of your scss into browser usable css. 

    a. cd into the sassScaffold directory
    b. run `sass --watch css:scss`

3. run `open index.html` in command line to see a very basic demo to help demonstrate how things connect in the directory set up


More detailed notes on SCSS code to come. Currently this is only a basic scaffold for files.
